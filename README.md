# Pewlett Hackard Analysis


## **Overview of Project**

The purpose of this analysis was to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard, with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments that are currently working at the company. This will prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to get ready for a mentorship initiative. 

The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.


## Results
